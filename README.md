Urban waste collection aid - UWC 2.0
Urban waste management is one of several significant problems faced by many countries in the
world and thus considered one of the important points to be improved in Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 11: sustainable cities and communities and SDG 6: clean water and sanitation. Particular
attention is given to developing countries that continue to prioritize development and economic
growth. In urban context, solid waste management is costly and ineffective. Improvement of waste
collection and management is emphasized by governments and organizations for positive impacts on
cities, societies and environments.
Waste collection is often designated to an organization that provides professional waste
management services. A typical waste collection process involves (1) back officers, who operate a
central system to create calendar, coordinate front collectors and janitors ,(2) collectors, who drive
different types of vehicles and (3) janitors who manually collect garbage from Major Collecting Points
(MCPs). Calendar and tasks were assigned among teams of janitors and coordinated by back officers.
These assignments are often arranged in a weekly basic. Back officers also plan which vehicles to use
and their routes. This planning activity happens every month. Everyday, the back officers sent
messages with information about collecting route and time to collectors and janitors. Janitors use
trollers (see Figure 1b) to collect garbage in their assigned areas and deliver to the MCPs. Collectors
will pick up garbage from all janitors at a MCP. One collector drives only one vehicle during his
working shift. The collector will drive through several MCPs with a predetermined route by back
officers.
Organization X is contracted to develop an information management system called UWC 2.0 in order
to improve efficiency of garbage collection of Service provider Y. The solution will include a Task
Management module that allows:
Back officers to:
1. Have an overview of janitors and collectors, their work calendar
2. Have an overview of vehicles and their technical details (weight, capacity, fuel consumptions,
etc)
3. Have an overview of all MCPs and information about their capacity. Information should be
updated from MCPs every 15 minutes with the availability of at least 95% of their operating
time.
4. Assign vehicles to janitors and collectors
5. Assign janitors and collectors to MCPs (task)
6. Create a route for each collector. Assigned route is optimized in term of fuel consumption
and travel distance.

7. Be able to send message to collectors and janitors
Collectors and janitors to:
1. Have an overview of their work calendar
2. Have a detail view of their task on a daily and weekly basic. All important information should
be displayed in one view (without scrolling down).
3. Be able to communicate with collectors, other janitors and back officers. The messages
should be communicated in a real-time manner with delay less than 1 second.
4. Check in / check out task every day
5. Be notified about the MCPs if they are fully loaded
There are some constraints to the development of UWC 2.0. There exists a current system UWC 1.0
with a database. UWC 2.0 is expected to import and to use the existing data from UWC1.0. It is
expected that the Task Management to be inter-operable with the UWC 1.0 as much as possible. The
system should be able to handle real-time data from at least 1000 MCPs at the moment and 10.000
MCPs in five years. UWC 2.0 system interfaces should be in Vietnamese, with an opportunity to
switch to English in the future.
