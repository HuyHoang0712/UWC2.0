# UWC2.0
Project for Software Engineering course

I - Introduction:
1. Identify the context of this project
- Along with economic development, urban waste management is one
of the biggest challenges we face today, especially in big cities. The
authorities need to come up with solutions to solve this problem in an
efficient, cost-effective way to achieve the development goals set out
in SDG 11 and SDG 6. This is the reason for the development of the
UWC 1.0 information management system.
- UWC 1.0 is a decent system but there are still many drawbacks, thus
after 5 years, UWC 2.0 is developed.
- UWC 2.0 is a more well-rounded developed version than UWC 1.0.
With UWC 2.0, Back officers, Collectors, and Janitors can manage
information and work schedules more easily and efficiently; At the
same time, it also supports the management of vehicle information
and waste collection points, thereby providing an efficient and
cost-effective operation solution. UWC 2.0 also integrates a
messaging function that allows contact information to be updated
quickly and promptly to facilitate the resolution of arising problems.

2. Who are the relevant stakeholders?
- Back officers
- Janitors
- Collectors

3. What are their current needs?
- As a Back officer, I need to have an overview of Janitors’ and
Collectors’ work calendars.
- As a Back officer, I need to have an overview of vehicles and their
technical details (including weight, capacity, fuel consumption, …)
- As a Back officer, I need an overview of all MCPs (major collecting
points) and information about their capacity. MCPs’ data should be
updated every 15 minutes with the availability of at least 95% of their
operating time.
- As a Back officer, I need to assign vehicles to Janitors and Collectors.
- As a Back officer, I need to be able to assign Janitors and Collectors
to MCPs.
- As a Back officer, I need to create a route for each Collector. The
route should be optimized in terms of fuel consumption and travel
distance.
- As a Back officer, I need to be able to send messages to Collectors
and Janitors.
- As a Collector/Janitor, I need to have an overview of my work
calendar.
- As a Collector/Janitor, I need to have an overview of my tasks on a
daily and weekly basis.
- As a Collector/Janitor, I need to be able to communicate with other
Collectors, Janitors, and Back officers.
- As a Collector/Janitor, I need to be able to check in / check out every
day.
- As a Collector/Janitor, I need to be notified about MCPs’ capacity.

4. What could be their current problem?
Employee
- Hard to manage employees (Collectors/Janitors):
- Hard to check daily and weekly tasks
- Hard to manage the human resource
- Not having an accessible working calendar for Collectors/Janitors,
Back officer:
- Can not effectively organize and distribute the tasks to staff
- Collectors/Janitors’ productivity may be decreased
Technical equipment
- Can not track technical equipment status (collecting vehicles, trollers)
- Not having a real-time means of communication:
- Can not handle spontaneous problems
- Delay information and report about the progress from
Collectors/Janitors to Back officer
Working progress
- Not having an optimized route or path for J/C:
- Wasting the resources (gasoline, time, ...)
- Duplicate the MCPs or collect path
- Not having a real-time management system:
- Hard to track the working progress of J/C
- Hard to keep records of working progress

5. What benefits the UWC 2.0 will be for each stakeholder?
- Back officers can manage and retrieve information from Collectors
and Janitors rapidly.
- Back officers can follow the status of all vehicles and Major
collecting points (MCPs), then can make an efficient operation and
cost - reduction.
- Back officers, Collectors, and Janitors can observe their working
calendar easily, thus avoiding time-consuming and improving
efficiency.
- Having a high response means of communication will help to solve a
sudden problem quickly and in a timely manner.
